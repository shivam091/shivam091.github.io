This is a personal technical blog, but I expect all interactions to be respectful â€” including comments, guest posts, or use of the contact page.

## Respect

Please treat others with respect, regardless of background, identity, opinions, or gender.  
Harassment of any kind, including sexual harassment, hate speech, or inappropriate behavior, will not be tolerated.

## Contributions (If Applicable)

If you contribute content (such as comments or guest posts), it should be:  
- Constructive and relevant  
- Free from hate speech, harassment, sexual harassment, or spam  

## Reporting

If you notice a violation of this Code of Conduct, you can report it via the [contact page](/contact).

Thank you for helping keep this space respectful, safe, and inclusive.
