Your privacy is important. This site collects only the information necessary to improve your experience and the site itself.

## Information Collected

This site collects limited information in two ways:

- **Analytics**: Google Analytics is used to understand visitor behavior (such as pages visited, browser type, approximate location).  
  Google may place cookies and collect anonymized usage data. Learn more in [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

- **Preferences**: Your theme (light/dark) and other settings (such as sound preferences) are stored in your browser’s localStorage.  
  This data remains on your device and is never shared.

## Third-Party Services

Currently, the only third-party service used is **Google Analytics**, which helps measure site traffic and engagement.  
You can opt out of Google Analytics using [this tool](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

## Your Choices

You may disable cookies or JavaScript in your browser, though some features may not work correctly.  
You may also opt out of Google Analytics tracking using the link above.

## Data Retention

- Google Analytics data is retained by Google according to their policies.  
- LocalStorage preferences remain in your browser until you clear them.

## Sharing & Security

I do not sell, trade, or share your personal information.  

Some posts may include embeds or previews (such as GitHub or YouTube), and those platforms may collect their own usage data under their privacy policies.
I am not responsible or liable for the privacy practices of third parties, and I strongly recommend that you review a third party’s privacy policy before
disclosing any personal information to the third party.

## Changes to this Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are encouraged to periodically review this page for the latest version.  
If changes are made, the most recent version will always be available here.

## Contact

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please [reach out through the contact page](/contact).
